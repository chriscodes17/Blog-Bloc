This is a blogging site I created as a final project for the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy.

This application is ran by NodeJS and mongoDB as the database. Users can sign up, login, like, comment and post blogs. As well as shuffle to a random blog in the database.

Bootstrap 4 was used to create the layout, along side CSS for the UI design.

This is my first fullstack project and I am happy to share it with everyone!
